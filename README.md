# AutoMCU
Python implementation of AutoMCU spectral unmixing algorithm:

 Automated Monte-Carlo Unmixing (AutoMCU) is an unmixing approach, the algorithm was written in C++ language by Asner, G. P., and K. B. Heidebrecht. in 2003 (Imaging spectroscopy for desertification studies: Comparing AVIRIS and EO-1 Hyperion in Argentina drylands. IEEE transactions on geoscience and remote sensing: a publication of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society 41:1283â€“1296),  and has translated to Python by Nick Vaughn and Elahe Jamalinia in 2023.
